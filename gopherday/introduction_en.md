# iThome #Gopher Day

## Introduction:
The birth of a programming language offers a brand new perspective of constructing the world.

Go (Golang) is a programming language developed by Google. As a modern programming language which is born in 21st century, in addition to integrate advantages of previous programming languages, Go devotes lots of efforts on alleviating the burden as well as optimizing the process of developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining a system.

The syntax of Go is quite concise; with a very low entry barrier, a novice programmer could get started as fast as experienced programmers using different programming language. Actually, as you might know already, lots of experienced started to use Go because of its superior performance. Through rigorous syntax, format, test, and various kinds of procedures, programmers could dramatically reduce the possibility of making mistakes. The standard library provides strong support for programmer during the process of development; the compiled source code also streamlines the process of online deployment.

The iThome #Gopher Day would not only lead you to a wonderful journey of developing software, but also offer practical solutions to decipher tricky problems about efficiency and deployment. Participating iThome #Gopher Day would be a great start to know more about Go and a wonderful chance to share your experiences of software development.
